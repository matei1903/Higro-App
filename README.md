# Higro-App
A college project where I built a web app using JS, HTML and CSS, with electron framework and database. The app provides details about the evolution of the temperature between the inside and outside of a building and how the pressure is changing in this process.
The application is using a Database that can be custom selected by the client and must contain information on the materials that are used for thermal isolation.
